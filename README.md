# pyOTP
`pyOTP` is a Python 3 implementation of the following Internet Engineering Task Force One-Time Password (OTP) algorithms:

* HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) proposed by [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226).
* Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) proposed by [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

`pyOTP` uses [zbarlite](https://github.com/Polyconseil/zbarlight) to read qrcodes as a source for the shared key.
